Place your login background images and logo in this folder.
To replace the logo(Digital Experience Cloud text), you will need to name the file epi_login_logo.svg (it must be an svg file.)

You can have up to three different background images(Currently Episerver only has three different images).
The following file formats are supported: jpeg,jpg,gif,png

If you don't want to use this folder structure you can specify your own in Appsettings using the key JOS.LoginScreen.ImageFolder.
The value should be the relative path to the folder. Example: static\img\login
